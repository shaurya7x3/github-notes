Key Concepts in GitHub
Repository:

A repository, or repo, is a storage space where your project and its files reside. It can be either public or private.
Each repository has its own unique URL and can contain folders, files, documentation, and more.
Repositories enable version control, issue tracking, and collaboration.
Branch:

A branch is an independent line of development within a repository. It allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.
Branches can be created, switched between, merged, and deleted, providing flexibility in managing code changes.
Commit:

A commit represents a specific change or set of changes made to a repository. It captures a snapshot of the project at a given point in time.
Commits are accompanied by commit messages, which describe the purpose and details of the changes made.
Pull Request (PR):

A pull request is a way to propose changes from one branch to another, typically from a feature branch to the main branch.
Pull requests facilitate code review and collaboration. They allow team members to discuss changes, suggest modifications, and ensure code quality before merging.
Merge:

Merging combines changes from one branch into another, integrating the commits made on separate branches.
When a pull request is approved, the changes can be merged into the target branch, such as merging a feature branch into the main branch.
Fork:

Forking a repository creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account.
Forked repositories enable you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. You can make modifications and submit pull requests to contribute back to the original repository.
Clone:

Cloning a repository creates a local copy on your computer, allowing you to work on the project offline and make changes to the code.
Cloned repositories maintain a connection to the original repository, enabling synchronization with remote changes.
Issue Tracking:

GitHub provides a built-in issue tracking system where you can report bugs, suggest enhancements, or create task lists.
Issues can be assigned, labeled, commented on, and closed, providing a centralized way to manage project-related discussions and tasks.
